## Exploration ideas for the counted.

Rank state/race pairs by likelihood
Look at everything and then go to male only
How many police departments have no kills?
Murder rate by state then department of police officers.
Correllation between murder rate and PO kills?
How many states under-kill each race?
What would this picture look like if things had equal outcome?
- That is, what is the space where all groups are statistically equal at 
99% confidence?
